# Analyzing Chopin's Composition Career

My motivation for this project was trying to understand the thought process behind composer Frédéric François Chopin in his music-making career. Using clustering and dimensionality reduction, I realized that the labels that Chopin uses for some of his works (e.g. piano sonata, etude, mazurka) do not necessarily indicate any similarity across them: many mazurkas, for instance, were separated into different clusters by the machine, so each mazurka is probably noticeably distinct from each other. Furthermore, I made a classifier to determine how easy it is to predict the opus number of a Chopin composition based on a set of the works' features. The classifier was able to predict the opus number of a piece with approximately 65% accuracy, but closer inspection of the classifier reveals that 1) the classifier had a relatively high accuracy score due to its strong ability to not incorrectly classify a piece's opus number and 2) the feature that helps the classifier to best predict a song's opus number is the year(s) it was published. Hence, the classifier reveals that the works included in a Chopin opus are very unique from each other. This outcome suggests that Chopin's method of composing is probably dissimilar to the "era" approach that many artists today have seemed to adopt (i.e. releasing songs with the same mood in an album at a specific point in time).
